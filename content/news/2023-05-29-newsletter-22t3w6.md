> Well, hopefully you are all caught up with exams. If you finished already, congratulations! If you haven't, I am sorry and you can be angry because I don't blame you. **However,** if you are going to be angry, why not be angry with the rest of us at some of our weekly events? This includes free milk at **Milk Mondays**, a nice **Pub Meal** at Phantom Coach, some delicious snacks at **CompCafé**, and out typical gaming night for **Friday Night Gaming**.

> Otherwise, if you're finished, why not just pass by and hang out? :)
