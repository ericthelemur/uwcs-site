> It is somehow week eight? In other words, the term is basically ending? The academic year is essentially over? No more module stress for the next few months (or even permanently for some)?
>This is genuinely mind boggling. Yet, somehow here we are! Despite all of this, we are still hosting events, so if you're still on campus and want to do something with your new free time, you should definitely stop by.
>  We have all of the usuals going on, including our infamous *Milk Monday*, *weekly Pub Meal*, *CompCafé*, and our typical *Friday Night Gaming*!
> Check out what's going on and pass by if you can :)
